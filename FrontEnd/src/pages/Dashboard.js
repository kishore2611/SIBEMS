                  essential protection against the coronavirus is Face Mask as
                  recommended by the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. Everyone needs
                  to wear a mask to counter the virus spread from person to

                  providers work simultaneously and it is very hard to manage
                  these providers. It is important for event organizers that

                  so that they can contact them at any time to plan an event at
